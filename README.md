Prototype of a very very simple map to allow to query a photon server and display the results in a map based on react and leaflet.

It is not good clean code, it does not follow best practices of any kind. It is not pretty, it has no extraordinary features. It's a prototype!

## Make it work

Set the `PHOTON_URL` variable in OsmMapFind.jsx to the photon base url, for example, for a local install it would be `http://localhost:2322`.

Run `npm start` in the project directory, it should open the browser to the page [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
